  <title>Full Time Equivalency</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The acronym "FTE," which stands for full-time equivalence, is used in almost every
      conversation where the topic of funding is up for discussion. Although individuals that work
      closely with institutional funding often have a deep understanding and working relationship
      with the definitions, mathematics, and significance of of FTE, for those that do not, this
      chapter is written to provide that insight. Furthermore, this chapter can also serve as a
      reference to those who do continuosly work with FTE, and need a source to reference from tiem
      to time.

      In this chapter, the concept of full-time equivalence (FTE) will be developed through the lens of 
      the North Carolina Community College System (NCCCS). Additionally, the basic definitions used to 
      in discussing FTE will be given, along with examples of how FTE is calculated. Finally, this
      chapter will conclude with a section on the impact and importance of FTE related to not only the
      funding for academic program at institutions within the NCCCS, but also other funding allocations
      for budget items such as the president's salary and benefits, institutional and academic support 
      services, and academic funding allocations for both curriculum and continuting education programs.
