            The previous section established the definitions and calcualtions for full-time 
            equivalence. In this section, the impact that FTE has on college-level funding and
            how funds are allocated based on FTE is discussed. When reading this informaiton,
            it is important to keep in mind that the information and numbers represent the information

                    Certain courses in the NCCCS are associated with higher costs. This higher cost
                    is adjusted in the college's allocated funds based on a tiered system of funding.
                    The NCCCS uses a four-tier system. The following are the four tiers with their
                    respective funding level

        <title>Calculating Budget FTE</title>
        <p>
            The budget allocations based on FTE is calculated by multiplying the FTE of a course by
            the funding alloted for that course's tier. As an equation, this looks like
            <me>
                \textbf{FTE Budget Allocation} = \textbf{FTE} \times \textbf{Tier Funding Allocation}
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the tiers for courses, the amount of an institution's budget that is allocated 
            based on the FTE can be calculated. Using the information from 
            <xref ref="example-eng-111-with-21-students"/>, the budget allocation for the course 
            can be calculated. The following example illustrates this calculation.
        </p>

        <example xml:id="example-eng-111-with-21-students-allocation">
            <title>Budget Allocation for ENG-111 with 21 Students</title>
            <p>
                ENG-111 according to the NCCCCS is classified as a tier two course for FTE budget 
                allocations. In the previous example with ENG-111 and the number of students equal 
                to 21, the FTE was calculated to equal 1.969. Therefore, based on the tiered funding
                this particular section of ENG-111 would receive 
            </p>
            <p>
                The total funding allocation based on the teired funding and the FTE of
                an ENG-111 course with the number of students equal to 21 would receive a budget
                allocation of
                <md>
                    <mrow>\textbf{Budget Allocation} \amp = \textbf{FTE} \times \textbf{Tier Funding Allocation} </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = 1.969 \times 3721.27 </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = 7327.18 </mrow>
                </md>
                Therefore, when determing a college's funding allocation from the NCCCS State Office,
                this particular section of ENG-111 would generate $7,327.18 dollars in budget
                allocations.

            Another metric by which institutions and organizagion measure the financial outcomes of
            the services they offer is called the <term>Return on Investment (ROI)</term>. For 
            consistency, consider the following as the definition of return on investment for these
            notes.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Return on Investment is a performance metric used to calculate and compare a 
                    the financial efficiency and the net budgetary profits of a course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditionally, ROI is expressed as a percentage calculated by subtracting the
                    cost of a course by the budget allocation of the course divided by the budget
                    allocation of the course.
