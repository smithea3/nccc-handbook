    <title>Determing the ROI of Faculty</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Having developed the return on invstment (ROI) of a course, the natrual progression is
            to consider how the cost of offering a course differs depending on the contract type
            of the instructor teaching the course. This section aims to provide an overview of the
            calculation of costs of part-time faculty compared to the cost of full-time faculty 
            and the impact on ROI.

                Be advised that the contract pay and salaries discussed in this section may differ
                depending on pay scale changes in the NCCCS and any supplemental pay or 
                benefits that may be offered by the individual colleges. Therefore, when performing
                these calculations for specific colleges, it is important to use the values 
                specific to the institution in question.

        <introduction>
            <p> 
                Part-time faculty at a college serve an important role in the academic operations of
                colleges and universities. According to the <url
                        href="https://www.nccommunitycolleges.edu/about-us/resources/data-dashboards/employee-headcount/">NCCCS
                Employee Headcounts by Full/Part-time Status</url>, 47% of the faculty in the NCCCS were
                part-time faculty. At Mitchell Community College, 61% of faculty are part-time and only
                39% are full-time.
