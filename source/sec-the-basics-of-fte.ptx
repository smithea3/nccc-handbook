  <title>The Basics of Full-time Equivalence</title>

  <p> 
    The term full-time equivalence is not endemic to colleges and universities. Many human resources
    departments at other companies and organizations use the term full-time equivalence when
    determining business aspects. For example, a company may wish to calculate the profits per
    employee. To do so, they must consider the full-time employees and the part-time employees time
    into an equivalent measure for comparison and calculation. In mathematics, the process of
    calculating a singluar standard by which to compare individuals within a group is called <term>
    normalizing</term>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    As stated in the introduction of this chapter, the term FTE is used in other institutions and 
    organizations other than just colleges and university. Therefore, the following definitions
    are necessary to establish the calculations that will be discussed later.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-census-date">
    <title>Census Date</title>
    <p> 
      The [North Carolina] State Voard of Community College Code 1G SBCCC 200.93: Reporting of
      Student Hours in Membership for Curriculum Classes states that the <term>census date</term> is
     the date at which 10% of the course's meeting time has occured. 
    </p>
  </definition>

  <definition xml:id="def-number-of-students">
    <title>Number of Students</title>
    <p>
      The <term>number of students</term> is the number of students participating in a course at the <xref ref="def-census-date" text="title" /> of the course.
    </p>
  </definition>

  <definition xml:id="def-student-membership-hours">
    <title>Student Membership Hours</title>
    <p>
      The <term>student membership hours</term> is the total number of hours each student meets in a course.
    </p>
  </definition>

  <definition xml:id="def-course-membership-hours">
    <title>Course Membership Hours</title>
    <p>
      The <term>course membership hours</term> is the total number of <xref ref="def-student-membership-hours" text="title" /> in a course.
    </p>
    <p>
      To calculate the course members hours, the formula for this calculation is
      <me>
        \text{Course Membership Hours} = \text{Contact Hours} \times 16.
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that course membership hours, regardless of the number of weeks that a course meets, is
      calculated using a 16-week baseline.
    </p>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Consider the following example to give context to these definition.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider an ENG-111: Writing and Inquiry course that originally had 24 students on 
        the roster at the start date of the course. Now consider, as you may have witnessed,
       that two students drop the course before the <xref ref="def-census-date" text="title" />,
        and another student never participated in any part of the course by the Census Date.
        This means that 21 students are participating in the course at the Census Date; therefore,
        the <xref ref="def-number-of-students" text="title" /> in the course would be 21.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The <xref ref="def-student-membership-hours" text="text" /> for ENG-111,
        the calculati
