  <title>The Basics of Full-time Equivalence</title>

  <p> 
    The term full-time equivalence is not endemic to colleges and universities. Many human resources
    departments at other companies and organizations use the term full-time equivalence when
    determining business aspects. For example, a company may wish to calculate the profits per
    employee. To do so, they must consider the full-time employees and the part-time employees time
    into an equivalent measure for comparison and calculation. In mathematics, the process of
    calculating a singluar standard by which to compare individuals within a group is called <term>
    normalizing</term>.

  <p>
    As stated in the introduction of this chapter, the term FTE is used in other institutions and 
    organizations other than just colleges and university. Therefore, the following definitions
    are necessary to establish the calculations that will be discussed later.
