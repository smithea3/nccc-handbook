  <title>The Basics of Full-time Equivalence</title>

  <p> 
    The term full-time equivalence is not specific to colleges and universities. Many human resources
    departments at other companies and organizations use the term full-time equivalence when
    determining business aspects. For example, a company may wish to calculate the profits per
    employee. To do so, they must consider the full-time employees and the part-time employees time
    into an equivalent measure for comparison and calculation. In mathematics, the process of
    calculating a standard by which to compare individuals within a group is a process called 
    <term>normalization</term>.

      <title>Definitions for NCCCS FTE Calculation</title>
    <p>
      As stated in the introduction of this chapter, the term FTE is used in other institutions and 
      organizations other than just colleges and university. Therefore, the following definitions
      are necessary to establish the calculations specific to college and universities.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-contact-hours">
      <title>Contact Hours</title>
      
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          The number of <term>contact hours</term> of a course is the actual time of student 
          attendance in a class or lab. For records purposes, 60 minutes constitutes an hour.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the Nurse Aide I (NAS-101) in the NCCCS Combined Course Library. This course
          has three class hours, four lab hours, and three clinical hours. This would sum to be 10
          contact hours for the course.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <definition xml:id="def-credit-hours">
      <title>Credit Hours</title>
      <p>
        The number of contact hours of a course is different from the <term>credit hours</term>.
        The number of credit hours is calculated based on a weighted average of the four designations 
        for meeting times (i.e., class, lab, clinical, and work). The weights for the meeting time 
        designations are 1, 0.5, <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> and 0.10 respectively.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For example, the Nurse Aide I (NAS-101) course would have six credit hours based on the 
          weighted calculation as follows:
          <md>
            <mrow>\textbf{Credit Hours} \amp = 3 \times 1 + 4 \times 0.5 + 6 \times \frac{1}{6} + 0 \times 0  </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = 6 </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <definition xml:id="def-census-date">
      <title>Census Date</title>
      <p> 
        The [North Carolina] State Voard of Community College Code 1G SBCCC 200.93: Reporting of
        Student Hours in Membership for Curriculum Classes states that the <term>census date</term> is
        the date at which 10% of the course's meeting time has occured. 
      </p>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="def-number-of-students">
      <title>Number of Students</title>
      <p>
        The <term>number of students</term> is the number of students participating in a course at the 
        <xref ref="def-census-date" text="title" /> of the course.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="def-student-membership-hours">
      <title>Student Membership Hours</title>
      <p>
        The <term>student membership hours</term> is the total number of <term>contact hours</term>
         each student meets in a course.
      </p>
      <p>
        To calculate the student membership hours (SMH), the formula is
        <me>
          \textbf{Student Membership Hours} = \textbf{Contact Hours} \times 16.
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that student membership hours, regardless of the number of weeks that a course meets, is
        calculated using a 16-week baseline.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <definition xml:id="def-course-membership-hours">
      <title>Course Membership Hours</title>
      <p>
        The <term>course membership hours</term> is the total number of 
        <xref ref="def-student-membership-hours" text="title" /> in a course.
      </p>
      <p>
        To calculate the course membership hours, the formula is
        <me>
          \textbf{Course Membership Hours (CMH)} = \textbf{Student Membership Hours} \times \textbf{Number of Students}
        </me>
      </p>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Consider the following example to give context to these definitions.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-eng-111-with-21-students">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider an ENG-111: Writing and Inquiry course that originally had 24 students on 
          the roster at the start date of the course. Now consider, as you may have witnessed,
        that two students drop the course before the <xref ref="def-census-date" text="title" />,
          and another student never participated in any part of the course by the Census Date.
          This means that 21 students are participating in the course at the Census Date; therefore,
          the <xref ref="def-number-of-students" text="title" /> in the course would be 21.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For ENG-111, the number of contact hours is set at three hours. Therefore, the 
          <xref ref="def-student-membership-hours" text="title" /> (CMH) for ENG-111, is calclated to be
          <me>
            \textbf{ENG-111's SMH} = 3 \times 16 = 48.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, the course membership hours would be
          <me>
            \textbf{ENG-111 with 21 Number of Students' CMH} = 48 \times 21 = 1008

    <title>Calculating FTE in the NCCCS</title>
    <warning>
      <p>
        Be advised that the numbers for FTE used in this part of this section are subject to change. 
        Specifically, the denominator value discussed below may change with new laws, policies, and
        procedures created at the state level. While the best effort is made to ensure that the 
        numbers used in this text is accurate, the informationw written herein represents the latest
        numbers as of <today />.

      <title>The FTE Denominator</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Again, when considering the calculations for FTE, it is important to have a metric by which 
          to compare a course's enrollment on a full-time basis (hence the term full-time equivalence).
          A value that <term>normalizes</term> the course membership hours is needed to compare the
          various courses enrollment contribution to an institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of <today /> the number that is used to normalize a course's enrollment contribution
          is 512. To get this value, the NCCCS considers the average full-time student to have 16 
          contact hours of courses, multiplied by 16 weeks in a semester, multiplied by 2 semesters
          in an academic year.

      <statement>
        <p>
          To calculate the FTE of a course in the NCCCS, the course membership hours is divided by 
          512 (see <xref ref="fact-fte-denominator" text="title" />). The formula for this calculation
          is
